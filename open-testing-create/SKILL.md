# open-testing-create — Test Case & Test Data Generator (CREATES Agents)

## What This Skill Does

This skill generates **concrete test cases, test data, and test scripts** from a test design technique and context. It uses 7 specialized agents (CREATES mnemonic) to parse technique name, load technique procedure from KB, enumerate test conditions systematically, author concrete test cases with IDs and inputs, trace back to requirements, export in desired format, and calculate coverage metrics.

**Key flow:**
1. **Context Agent** — Parse technique name and test context
2. **Rules Agent** — Extract business rules and acceptance criteria
3. **Enumerate Agent** — Apply technique procedure step-by-step
4. **Author Agent** — Create concrete test cases with IDs, inputs, expected results
5. **Trace Agent** — Link test cases to requirements and risk items
6. **Export Agent** — Output as XLSX, Gherkin, JSON, or CSV
7. **Score Agent** — Calculate coverage metrics and identify gaps

## The 7 CREATES Agents

### C_context — Context Agent
**Function:** Parse technique name, load technique procedure from KB
**Process:**
1. Extract technique name from user request
2. Normalize technique name (e.g., "BVA" → "boundary value analysis")
3. Look up technique-patterns.json → patterns[technique_name]
4. Load technique metadata: description, applicability, test_basis_required, typical_test_count
5. Load technique procedure from techniques/{technique_id}.json

**Example invocation:**
```
User: "Create test cases using boundary value analysis for age field (18-65)"
Context Agent:
  - Extracts: technique_name = "boundary value analysis"
  - Loads: technique-patterns.json["boundary value analysis"]
  - Gets: applicability = ["numeric partitions", "range testing"], typical_test_count = "3-5"
  - Loads: techniques/boundary-value-analysis.json → procedure steps
```

### R_rules — Rules Agent
**Function:** Extract business rules, constraints, acceptance criteria
**Process:**
1. Parse user context for domain rules (e.g., "age 18-65", "password 8-20 chars")
2. Extract constraints: min, max, format, allowed values, exclusions
3. Parse acceptance criteria (explicit or implicit)
4. Map constraints to technique parameters (partitions, boundaries, values)
5. Identify valid/invalid test conditions per rule

**Example invocation:**
```
User context: "age field: 18-65, must be integer, required field"
Rules Agent:
  - Identifies constraints:
      * Lower boundary: 18 (inclusive)
      * Upper boundary: 65 (inclusive)
      * Format constraint: integer only
      * Requirement: mandatory field
  - Maps to BVA partitions:
      * Partition 1: age < 18 (invalid)
      * Partition 2: 18 ≤ age ≤ 65 (valid)
      * Partition 3: age > 65 (invalid)
  - Identifies boundaries: 17, 18, 19, 64, 65, 66
```

### E_enumerate — Enumerate Agent
**Function:** Apply technique procedure to enumerate test conditions
**Process:**
1. Apply technique-specific enumeration algorithm
2. Systematically generate test conditions
3. Map conditions to technique coverage requirements
4. Calculate expected coverage percentage

**For Boundary Value Analysis:**
```
Procedure:
  1. Identify boundaries: min, min+1, nominal, max-1, max
  2. For 2 boundaries (age 18-65):
     - Test cases: 17, 18, 19, 64, 65, 66
  3. Coverage: 6 test cases cover 3 partitions (100% partition coverage)
```

**For Equivalence Partitioning:**
```
Procedure:
  1. Partition values into equivalence classes
  2. Select representative from each partition
  3. For age (18-65):
     - Partition 1 (< 18): test value = 5
     - Partition 2 (18-65): test value = 30
     - Partition 3 (> 65): test value = 90
  4. Coverage: 3 test cases cover 3 partitions (100% partition coverage)
```

**For Decision Table:**
```
Procedure:
  1. Identify conditions and actions
  2. Create truth table (2^n rows where n = conditions)
  3. Example: password validation (3 conditions = 8 rows)
     - Condition A: length >= 8? T/F
     - Condition B: has uppercase? T/F
     - Condition C: has digit? T/F
     Actions: Accept, Reject reason
  4. Generate all 8 combinations
  5. Coverage: 8 test situations cover all combinations (100% decision table coverage)
```

**For State Transition Testing:**
```
Procedure:
  1. Identify states and transitions
  2. Build state table
  3. Generate transition sequences (0-switch, 1-switch, 2-switch)
  4. Example: Login flow states = (LoggedOut, Authenticating, LoggedIn, LockedOut)
     Transitions: Login, Logout, Failed, Locked
  5. Generate test cases for each transition
  6. Coverage: N transitions covered at specified coverage level
```

### A_author — Author Agent
**Function:** Author concrete test cases with ID, precondition, input, action, expected result
**Process:**
1. For each enumerated test condition:
2. Create test case ID (TC-{sequence}-{technique}-{variant})
3. Author precondition (test setup required)
4. Author input (values, data)
5. Author action (user action or system operation)
6. Author expected result (assertion)
7. Author postcondition (cleanup)
8. Assign priority (critical, high, medium, low)

**Example output:**

| Test ID | Precondition | Input | Action | Expected Result | Post-Condition | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------|--------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| TC-001-BVA-LB | Age field on form | 17 | Submit form | Error: "Age must be 18+" | Form not submitted | High |
| TC-002-BVA-LB+1 | Age field on form | 18 | Submit form | Form submitted successfully | Record created | Critical |
| TC-003-BVA-NOM | Age field on form | 30 | Submit form | Form submitted successfully | Record created | Medium |
| TC-004-BVA-UB-1 | Age field on form | 64 | Submit form | Form submitted successfully | Record created | Medium |
| TC-005-BVA-UB | Age field on form | 65 | Submit form | Form submitted successfully | Record created | Critical |
| TC-006-BVA-OOB | Age field on form | 66 | Submit form | Error: "Age cannot exceed 65" | Form not submitted | High |

### T_trace — Trace Agent
**Function:** Create traceability links from test cases to requirements and risk items
**Process:**
1. Parse user context for requirement/risk references (e.g., "REQ-001", "RISK-003")
2. For each test case, determine which requirement it validates
3. Create bidirectional traceability: Test Case ↔ Requirement
4. For risk-based tests, link to risk items
5. Calculate coverage: #requirements covered / #requirements total

**Example:**
```
Test Case TC-001-BVA-LB validates:
  - Requirement: REQ-012 "Age must be between 18 and 65"
  - Risk: RISK-005 "Underage user registration"

Traceability:
  REQ-012 ← [TC-001, TC-002, TC-005, TC-006] (covered by 4 test cases)
  RISK-005 ← [TC-001] (mitigated by boundary testing)
  Coverage: REQ-012 = 100% (all boundaries tested)
```

### E_export — Export Agent
**Function:** Export test cases in requested format
**Process:**
1. Format options: XLSX, CSV, JSON, Gherkin (BDD)
2. For XLSX: Use xlsx skill with standard columns (ID, Precondition, Input, Action, Expected Result, Priority, Trace)
3. For Gherkin: Convert to BDD format with Scenario + Given/When/Then
4. For JSON: Export as structured data for CI/CD integration
5. For CSV: Simple comma-separated for import to other tools

**XLSX Format:**
```
Columns: Test ID | Precondition | Input | Action | Expected Result | Post-Condition |
         Priority | Req Link | Pass/Fail | Actual Result | Remarks
```

**Gherkin Format:**
```gherkin
Feature: Age Validation
  Scenario: Boundary Value Testing - Lower Bound
    Given the age input field is active
    When I enter 17 and submit
    Then an error message "Age must be 18+" appears
    And the form is not submitted

  Scenario: Boundary Value Testing - Valid Range
    Given the age input field is active
    When I enter 30 and submit
    Then the form is submitted successfully
    And a confirmation message appears
```

**JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "test_cases": [
    {
      "test_id": "TC-001-BVA-LB",
      "technique": "boundary value analysis",
      "precondition": "Age field on form",
      "input": {"age": 17},
      "action": "Submit form",
      "expected_result": "Error: Age must be 18+",
      "priority": "high",
      "requirement_links": ["REQ-012"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### S_score — Score Agent
**Function:** Calculate coverage metrics and identify gaps
**Process:**
1. Calculate technique coverage:
   - Partition coverage: #partitions covered / #partitions total
   - Boundary coverage: #boundaries tested / #boundaries identified
   - Condition coverage: #conditions tested / #conditions total
2. Calculate requirement coverage:
   - #requirements with ≥1 test case / #total requirements
3. Identify gaps:
   - Uncovered partitions, boundaries, conditions
   - Untested requirements or acceptance criteria
4. Suggest additional test cases to close gaps

**Example Coverage Report:**
```
Boundary Value Analysis (Age field 18-65):
  Partition Coverage: 3/3 (100%)
    - Partition 1 (< 18): COVERED [TC-001]
    - Partition 2 (18-65): COVERED [TC-002, TC-003, TC-004, TC-005]
    - Partition 3 (> 65): COVERED [TC-006]

  Boundary Coverage: 6/6 (100%)
    - 17 (below lower): COVERED [TC-001]
    - 18 (lower): COVERED [TC-002]
    - 19 (above lower): NOT TESTED - gap
    - 64 (below upper): COVERED [TC-004]
    - 65 (upper): COVERED [TC-005]
    - 66 (above upper): COVERED [TC-006]

  Requirement Coverage: 1/1 (100%)
    - REQ-012: COVERED by 6 test cases

  Total Test Count: 6
  Estimated Boundary Defect Detection Rate: 95%
```
