# Open Testing Design Strategy

The **open-testing-design** skill generates test strategies, quality engineering strategies, risk analysis, and technique selection using an 8-agent STRATEGY pipeline that transforms requirements and user stories into actionable quality engineering plans.

## STRATEGY Agent Pipeline

The STRATEGY mnemonic orchestrates eight specialized agents that work sequentially and in parallel:

1. **S_scope** - Scope Agent
2. **T_technique** - Technique Selector Agent
3. **R_risk** - Risk Agent
4. **A_approach** - Approach Agent
5. **T_testability** - Testability Agent
6. **E_estimation** - Estimation Agent
7. **G_governance** - Governance Agent
8. **Y_yield** - Yield Agent

## Agent Specifications

### S_scope: Scope Agent

**Purpose**: Define test scope from requirements, user stories, and business context.

**Inputs**:
- Requirements document or user stories
- Product/system description
- Stakeholder priorities

**Outputs**:

- Test Objects List (components, features, integrations)
- Quality Characteristics Matrix
- Scope Boundary Document

**Knowledge Base Files**:
- `terminology.json` - scope-related term definitions
- `ontology.json` - test object classification

**Processing**:
1. Parse requirements to identify test objects (UX, API, database, integrations)
2. Map quality characteristics relevant to each test object
3. Classify items as in/out of scope
4. Validate against stakeholder goals

### T_technique: Technique Selector Agent

**Purpose**: Select optimal test design techniques based on quality characteristics and coverage requirements.

**Inputs**:
- Quality characteristics from Scope Agent
- Coverage group requirements

**Mapping Logic**:

**Quality Characteristics (ISO 25010)**:

2. Performance Efficiency → Load testing, stress testing, scalability testing
3. Compatibility → Integration testing, interoperability testing
4. Usability → Exploratory testing, user scenario testing, accessibility testing
5. Reliability → Robustness testing, failure mode testing, error handling testing
6. Security → Penetration testing, threat modeling, security scanning
7. Maintainability → Code review, static analysis, test coverage analysis
8. Portability → Platform-specific testing, environment testing, deployment testing

**Technique Selection Algorithm**:
1. Identify quality characteristics for test object
2. Look up characteristic → technique mapping in `quality-to-technique.json`
3. Validate technique applicability using `technique-patterns.json`
4. Map technique to intensity level using `technique-to-intensity.json`
5. Generate coverage target (% of techniques adopted)

## Algorithm Summary

### Quality-to-Technique Selection
```
FOR EACH quality_characteristic:
  1. Look up sub-characteristics in quality-to-technique.json
  2. Find applicable techniques (filter by type: functional/non-functional)
  3. Get intensity levels from technique-to-intensity.json
  4. Calculate coverage target based on risk class:
     - Class A: 90% (thorough)
     - Class B: 70% (standard)
     - Class C: 50% (light)
  5. Validate technique applicability using technique-patterns.json
  6. Output technique recommendation with effort factor
```

### Risk Classification & Intensity Mapping
```
Risk Score = (Probability + Impact) / 2
IF Risk Score >= 7.5 THEN Class A, Intensity = Thorough
ELSE IF Risk Score >= 4.5 THEN Class B, Intensity = Standard
ELSE Class C, Intensity = Light

FOR EACH risk_class:
  Apply corresponding technique intensity
  Define coverage targets
  Set effort multiplier
```
